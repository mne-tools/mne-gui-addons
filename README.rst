MNE-GUI-Addons
--------------

This project contains graphical user interface (GUI) addons that complement the
scripting functionality in ``mne-python``, ``mne-bids`` and other ``mne`` projects
for tasks that require a user to interact with data, usually that is 3D, in order
for them to be accomplished. For example:

- Locating intracranial electrode contacts from a computed tomography (CT) or
  magnetic resonance (MR) scan
- Viewing time-frequency source estimate data
